For this assignment I decided to follow the mockup provided with the assignment. There is a nav bar at the top with links to 3 individual sections of the website and a big hero featuring a picture with a kaleidoscope effect that I took on my phone. There are multiple instances of flexbox and the "my-work" features a CSS grid that changes dimensions when the screen is the size of a cell-phone, that was one of the trickier parts of this project! Overall, I am pleased with the outcome and believe it checks all of the requirement boxes for the assignment. I intend on going back over the CSS and couble checking for redundancies or classes that could be grouped. I look forward to adding to this portfolio as I learn more tricks in this class!
